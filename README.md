# Reminder-Standup
>> This is a tool to remind MAC users to stand up after sitting for a long time either studying or working in front of a laptop/desktop.

## Description
> We do! (Or we should!) Those of us who work on computers daily may or may not realize the potential detriment to our health that is caused by sitting in the same position for long periods.
>>You might be a web developer, software engineer, data analyst, content writer, data reducer, graphic designer, etc. And we all know that daily we spend approximately 6-10 hours working on a single screen. And most of the people just forget how important it is for you to relax, this is one of the main reasons for young people to have 'Back Pain, Neck Pain, Dry Eyes, etc.'

## How To Run

- Run shell script file

**It is very important for a user to stand up, keep everything aside, and just relax, do some exercise to stretch the body.**
